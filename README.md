# C-Renderer
A 3D Graphics renderer written in C alongside Pikumas "Fundamentals of 3D Graphics" course. This repository is an academic exercise in learning how 3D graphics work and not meant to be representative of production level code. This repository specifically is configured to compile on linux/ubuntu based systems. 

Currently the 3D renderer supports:
- Full triangle rasterization using naive rounding approach.
- .obj file loading to load meshes.
- perspective correct texturing
- loading .png files for textures
- backface culling
- z buffer
- Flat shading lighting model
