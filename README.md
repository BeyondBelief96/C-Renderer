# C-Renderer
A C based 3-Dimensional graphical renderer utilizing SDL2.0. Renderer was made during 3D Graphics Course by Pikuma. 
This repository was an academic excercise in learning the fundamentals of 3-D graphics. The renderer currently supports
  - Basic 2-D and 3-D vector operations such as: addition, subtraction, dot & cross product, rotations, normalization.
  - Uses SDL2.0 to initialize a window and renderer.
  - Basic game loop implemented with a setup(), process_input(), update(), and render() functions.
  - Ability to draw points, rectangles, lines, and triangles.
  - Uses ideas of vertices and faces to describe a mesh.
  - Ability to read .obj files to load vertices and faces into meshes.
  - Backface culling is implemented to only render faces that face the camera.
